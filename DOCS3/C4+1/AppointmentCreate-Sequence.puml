  **Assignment 3 Features:**
  • Security: JWT (@PreAuthorize), mTLS, RBAC
  • Resilience: Circuit Breaker, Retry, Timeout
  • Observability: Zipkin (tracing), Prometheus (metrics), ELK (logs)
  • Event Sourcing: Immutable event storage
  • Correlation ID: End-to-end traceability
end note

Client -> Controller: POST /appointments\n(ScheduleAppointmentRequest)\nJWT Token
activate Controller

Controller -> CommandService: createAppointment(dto)\n[Trace ID propagated]
activate CommandService

CommandService -> Service: createAppointment(dto)
activate Service

Service -> Service: Validate appointment data

' External call with Circuit Breaker and Retry
Service -> ExternalClient: createAppointmentInRecords(appointmentData)\n[Circuit Breaker + Retry + mTLS]
activate ExternalClient

note right of ExternalClient
  Circuit Breaker checks state
  Retry with exponential backoff
  Metrics sent to Prometheus
  Trace sent to Zipkin
end note

ExternalClient --> Service: Appointment created in records
deactivate ExternalClient

Service -> ExternalClient: getPatientById(patientId)\n[Circuit Breaker + Retry + mTLS]
activate ExternalClient
ExternalClient --> Service: Patient data (Map)
deactivate ExternalClient

Service -> Service: Build Appointment with patient data
Service -> WriteRepo: save(appointment)
activate WriteRepo
WriteRepo --> Service: Appointment (saved)
deactivate WriteRepo

Service --> CommandService: Appointment
deactivate Service

' Event Sourcing - Save event to Event Store
CommandService -> EventStoreService: saveEvent(appointmentId,\nEventType.APPOINTMENT_CREATED,\nappointmentData,\ncorrelationId,\nuserId)
activate EventStoreService

note right of EventStoreService
  Event Sourcing:
  • Calculate version
  • Serialize to JSON
  • Save immutable event
  • Metrics to Prometheus
end note

EventStoreService --> CommandService: EventStore (saved)
deactivate EventStoreService

' Publish to RabbitMQ with Circuit Breaker and Retry
CommandService -> RabbitMQ: convertAndSend("appointment.created", event)\n[Retry + Circuit Breaker]
activate RabbitMQ

note right of RabbitMQ
  AMQP publishing:
  • Retry on failure
  • Metrics to Prometheus
  • Correlation ID in message
end note

RabbitMQ --> CommandService: Event published
deactivate RabbitMQ

CommandService -> RabbitMQ: convertAndSend("appointment.reminder", event)
activate RabbitMQ
RabbitMQ --> CommandService: Reminder event published
deactivate RabbitMQ

CommandService --> Controller: Appointment
deactivate CommandService

Controller --> Client: 200 OK\nAppointment
deactivate Controller
deactivate Client

note right of RabbitMQ
  **Asynchronous processing:**
  Events consumed by handlers
  with correlation ID propagation
end note

RabbitMQ -> EventHandler: AppointmentCreatedEvent\n[Correlation ID]
activate RabbitMQ
activate EventHandler

note right of EventHandler
  Handler processing:
  • Extract Correlation ID
  • Trace to Zipkin
  • Metrics to Prometheus
end note

EventHandler -> ReadRepo: findById(appointmentId)
activate ReadRepo
ReadRepo --> EventHandler: Optional<AppointmentSummary>
deactivate ReadRepo

alt Summary exists
    EventHandler -> WriteRepo: findById(appointmentId)
    activate WriteRepo
    WriteRepo --> EventHandler: Optional<Appointment>
    deactivate WriteRepo

    alt Appointment found and status is CANCELED
        EventHandler -> EventHandler: Ignore old creation event
    else Appointment found and status different from event
        EventHandler -> EventHandler: Update summary with write model data
        EventHandler -> ReadRepo: save(AppointmentSummary)
        activate ReadRepo
        ReadRepo --> EventHandler: Saved
        deactivate ReadRepo
    else Appointment not found
        EventHandler -> EventHandler: Create new summary from event
        EventHandler -> ReadRepo: save(AppointmentSummary)
        activate ReadRepo
        ReadRepo --> EventHandler: Saved
        deactivate ReadRepo
    end
else Summary doesn't exist
    EventHandler -> EventHandler: Create new summary from event
    EventHandler -> ReadRepo: save(AppointmentSummary)
    activate ReadRepo
    ReadRepo --> EventHandler: Saved
    deactivate ReadRepo
end

EventHandler -> EventHandler: Update MongoDB read model
deactivate EventHandler

RabbitMQ -> ReminderHandler: AppointmentReminderEvent\n[Correlation ID]
deactivate RabbitMQ
activate ReminderHandler

ReminderHandler -> ReminderHandler: sendReminderEmail(event)
ReminderHandler -> ReminderHandler: Log reminder details\n[Structured logging to ELK]
deactivate ReminderHandler

note right of Controller
  **Este diagrama mostra a criação de uma nova consulta**
  com todas as implementações do Assignment 3:
  
  • **Security:** JWT validation, mTLS, RBAC
  • **Resilience:** Circuit Breaker, Retry, Timeout
  • **Observability:** Distributed tracing (Zipkin),
    Metrics (Prometheus), Structured logging (ELK)
  • **Event Sourcing:** Immutable event storage
  • **Correlation ID:** End-to-end traceability
