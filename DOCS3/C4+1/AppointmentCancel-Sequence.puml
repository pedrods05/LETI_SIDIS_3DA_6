  **Assignment 3 Features:**
  • Security: JWT (@PreAuthorize), mTLS, RBAC
  • Resilience: Circuit Breaker, Retry, Timeout
  • Observability: Zipkin (tracing), Prometheus (metrics), ELK (logs)
  • Event Sourcing: Immutable event storage
  • Correlation ID: End-to-end traceability
end note

Client -> Controller: PUT /appointments/{id}/cancel\nJWT Token
activate Controller

Controller -> CommandService: cancelAppointment(appointmentId)\n[Trace ID propagated]
activate CommandService

CommandService -> Service: cancelAppointment(appointmentId)
activate Service

' External call with Circuit Breaker and Retry
Service -> ExternalClient: cancelAppointmentInRecords(appointmentId)\n[Circuit Breaker + Retry + mTLS]
activate ExternalClient

note right of ExternalClient
  Circuit Breaker checks state
  Retry with exponential backoff
  Failures ignored (compensation possible)
  Metrics sent to Prometheus
end note

ExternalClient --> Service: Canceled (or exception ignored)
deactivate ExternalClient

Service -> WriteRepo: findById(appointmentId)
activate WriteRepo
WriteRepo --> Service: Optional<Appointment>
deactivate WriteRepo

Service -> Service: Set status = CANCELED
Service -> WriteRepo: save(appointment)
activate WriteRepo
WriteRepo --> Service: Appointment (status = CANCELED)
deactivate WriteRepo

Service --> CommandService: Appointment
deactivate Service

' Event Sourcing - Save event to Event Store
CommandService -> EventStoreService: saveEvent(appointmentId,\nEventType.APPOINTMENT_CANCELED,\nappointmentData,\ncorrelationId,\nuserId)
activate EventStoreService

note right of EventStoreService
  Event Sourcing:
  • Calculate version
  • Serialize to JSON
  • Save immutable event
  • Metrics to Prometheus
end note

EventStoreService --> CommandService: EventStore (saved)
deactivate EventStoreService

' Publish to RabbitMQ with Circuit Breaker and Retry
CommandService -> RabbitMQ: convertAndSend("appointment.canceled", event)\n[Retry + Circuit Breaker]
activate RabbitMQ

note right of RabbitMQ
  AMQP publishing:
  • Retry on failure
  • Metrics to Prometheus
  • Correlation ID in message
end note

RabbitMQ --> CommandService: Event published
deactivate RabbitMQ

CommandService --> Controller: Appointment
deactivate CommandService

Controller --> Client: 200 OK\nAppointment (CANCELED)
deactivate Controller
deactivate Client

note right of RabbitMQ
  **Asynchronous processing:**
  Events consumed by handlers
  with correlation ID propagation
end note

RabbitMQ -> EventHandler: AppointmentCanceledEvent\n[Correlation ID]
deactivate RabbitMQ
activate EventHandler

note right of EventHandler
  Handler processing:
  • Extract Correlation ID
  • Trace to Zipkin
  • Metrics to Prometheus
end note

EventHandler -> ReadRepo: findById(appointmentId)
activate ReadRepo
ReadRepo --> EventHandler: Optional<AppointmentSummary>
deactivate ReadRepo

alt Summary exists and status is SCHEDULED or COMPLETED
    EventHandler -> EventHandler: Ignore old cancellation event
else Summary doesn't exist or status allows cancellation
    EventHandler -> WriteRepo: findById(appointmentId)
    activate WriteRepo
    WriteRepo --> EventHandler: Optional<Appointment>
    deactivate WriteRepo

    alt Appointment found in write model
        EventHandler -> EventHandler: Preserve all appointment fields
        EventHandler -> ReadRepo: save(AppointmentSummary with status CANCELED)
        activate ReadRepo
        ReadRepo --> EventHandler: Saved
        deactivate ReadRepo
    else Appointment not found
        EventHandler -> ReadRepo: save(AppointmentSummary from event)
        activate ReadRepo
        ReadRepo --> EventHandler: Saved
        deactivate ReadRepo
    end
end

EventHandler -> EventHandler: Update MongoDB read model
deactivate EventHandler

note right of Controller
  **Este diagrama mostra o cancelamento de uma consulta**
  com todas as implementações do Assignment 3:
  
  • **Security:** JWT validation, mTLS, RBAC
  • **Resilience:** Circuit Breaker, Retry, Timeout
    (Failures em Records Service são ignorados - compensação possível)
  • **Observability:** Distributed tracing (Zipkin),
    Metrics (Prometheus), Structured logging (ELK)
  • **Event Sourcing:** Immutable event storage
  • **Correlation ID:** End-to-end traceability
end note
